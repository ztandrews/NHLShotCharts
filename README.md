# NHLShotCharts
Using Python to Make NHL Shot Charts

These aren't dont yet but they're looking pretty good. Heres a few example outputs:

### NHLGameShotChart.py
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68918006/147365443-03a3921e-cc6d-416f-b179-0806c7c08ffd.png)

This program shows the shots for a single NHL game.


### AllIslandersShots.py
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68918006/147365563-d6903bf2-a9bb-43e8-9d57-7bc40c6a4a69.png)

This shows all shots for a team in a year in the form of a hex heat map.




### TeamShotsAboveAverage.py
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68918006/147365400-97d4d44b-1c65-416d-91c1-e93eb1de4eac.png)

This one isn't done yet because I need to find a way to compare a teams shots to league average at each bin location


### AllIslandersShotsSmooth.py
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68918006/148008701-94ca0683-bb5d-4aa6-a555-245257557748.png)

Same as AllIslandersShots.py but this time it's a smooth heatmap. I still want to add a way to compare shot locations to league average
